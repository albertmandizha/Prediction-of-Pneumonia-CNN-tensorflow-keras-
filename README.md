This project focuses on exploring the efficacy of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in the early detection of pneumonia through the analysis of chest X-ray images. Leveraging a dataset sourced from Kaggle, we employ state-of-the-art techniques in deep learning, utilizing TensorFlow and Keras frameworks to train our CNN model.

Our methodology encompasses rigorous data preprocessing techniques including resizing, normalization, and augmentation, aimed at enhancing the accuracy and robustness of the model. Through meticulous experimentation, we iteratively refine our approach to ensure optimal performance.

Upon conducting our preliminary analysis, we observe promising results. After only two epochs of training, our CNN model demonstrates a commendable accuracy of 94%, showcasing a substantial enhancement from the baseline accuracy of 89%. However, we encounter challenges associated with the imbalanced nature of the dataset, particularly evident in the model's performance on normal data.

Despite the notable strides achieved, this preliminary report underscores the necessity for further investigation. Addressing the issue of imbalanced data warrants attention, and we envisage exploring diverse strategies to ameliorate the model's performance. Moreover, avenues for future exploration include the incorporation of advanced techniques and methodologies to refine the early detection capabilities of CNNs in pneumonia diagnosis.

In summation, this preliminary investigation highlights the potential of CNNs as a formidable tool for the early detection of pneumonia from chest X-ray images. Our endeavor sets the stage for continued research, aiming to enhance the accuracy, reliability, and applicability of CNN-based approaches in medical image analysis.
